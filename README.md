# Project-22-Supply-Mission-1
There is a zombie apocalypse in a city named "Zombieland" and this helicopter delivers essentials like medicines and food to this city where half of the population has become a zombie. When the down arrow key is pressed the essential is dropped down from the helicopter. I hope you all like it.
